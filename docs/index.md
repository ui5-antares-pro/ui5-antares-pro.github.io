**UI5 Antares Pro** is a modular SAPUI5 library designed to standardize and accelerate the implementation of CRUD operations for OData EntitySets in enterprise applications.

Leveraging the OData model defined in the consuming application, the library dynamically generates UI elements such as dialogs, forms, and tables. Full lifecycle handling is provided, including data binding, submission, and error management. Support is also included for custom validation logic, which can be implemented by the consumer as needed.

> **Note**  
> The library currently supports only [sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel][UI5_V2_ODATA]. Support for OData v4 is not yet available.
